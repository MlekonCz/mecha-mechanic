# mecha-mechanic
I created this game for Mecha gameJam and after it ended I decided to put it here on git hub. 
After that I took some time to learn more in depth things about C# and different design patterns.
And now (22.11.2021) I came back to the project to reffactor it and make it full fledged game. 
After I will be done with refactoring important stuff I will move on adding new features.
