# mecha-mechanic
I created this game for Mecha gameJam and after it ended I decided to put it here on git hub. 
Initial commit is version that was used in GameJam with some small bug fixes.
After that I took some time to learn more in depth things about C# and different design patterns.
And now (22.11.2021) I came back to the project to reffactor it and make it full fledged game eventually. 

Controls: 
- wasd - movement
- E - picking up items and interaction
- F - putting item in „repair station“ 
- Q - quitting UI


For those who will be looking into my code. Please keep in mind that I only refactored ome parts of my code. 
I will be refactoring more code when I will need to use it. Until then only look on code that was changed after initial commit.
